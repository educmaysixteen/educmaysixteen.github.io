                        <b>A student debarred from a faculty / college / institute may be admitted to another program of another faculty / college / institute provided that the cause of debarment is not due to nine (9.0) units of “unremoved failure” in the general courses. Aptly called “academic rechanneling,” this procedure gives “displaced students” a second chance. However, a student can avail of this only once. Academic re-channeling may be allowed in any program where the failed requirements do not apply, as long as the students meet all other requirements prescribed for the second program (Source: UST Student Handbook PPS No. 1007).</b>
                        <br><br>
                        11. May a student who has finished Bachelor of Secondary Education or Bachelor of Elementary Education retake the degree, this time with a different area of specialization or major (e. g. a student who has finished BSEd English and intends to take BSEd Math for the second degree or a BEEd major in PSEd graduate who wishes to take SPEd)?
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Yes. However, courses covered by credit transfer need not be repeated (e. g. the general education courses finished during the first degree). Should the student wish to repeat them for personal reasons, grades obtained and credits earned do not count for weighted average and academic honors (Source: UST Student Handbook PPS 1008b).</b>
                        <br><br>
                        12. A student misses a quiz in his class for participating in a college activity. When he returned to class, he presented an excuse letter signed by the Dean. Will the student’s absence not be deducted from the allowable number of absences?<br><br>
